I’m a graduate student at Stanford, working towards a Master’s in Statistics. My coursework is largely in prediction and machine learning, employing statistical models like regularized linear models and basis expansions as well as deep learning techniques. I have worked on projects in generative language modeling, recommendation systems, experimental design and implementation, tabular data augmentation, and document embeddings. Most recently, I worked at C3.ai for the summer using data science techniques to improve COVID-19 modeling and create publicly available data resources.

&nbsp;

Before returning to school, I worked in New York at [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudson-trading.com), a high-frequency algorithmic trading firm. There I served as a Python developer, automating clearing and settlement, conducting statistical analyses, and coordinating technical development for new initiatives. Prior to HRT, I spent some time in DC working for [Berkeley Research Group](https://www.thinkbrg.com) constructing damages models on behalf of firms in litigation.

&nbsp;

I'm a self-taught programmer and spend my free time working on personal projects and learning new frameworks. I'm a fan of economics blogs, Fed watching, and Russian lit.
